HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) - 
 *  Most internet communications are made with web requests through the HTTP protocol. 
 *  HTTP is an application-level protocol used to access the World Wide Web resources.
 *  HTTP communication consists of a client and a server, where the client requests the server for a resource. 
 *  The server processes the requests and returns the requested resource. 
 *  The default port for HTTP communication is port 80, though this can be changed to any other port, depending on the web server configuration. 
 
URL(Uniform Resource Location) - 
 *  Resources over HTTP are accessed via a URL, which offers many more specifications than simply specifying a website we want to visit.

        [  Scheme ] | This is used to identify the protocol being accessed by the client, and ends with a colon and a double slash (://).   |
        
        [   User  ] | This is an optional component that contains the credentials (separated by a colon :) used to authenticate to the host,|
                    | and is separated from the host with an at sign (@).                                                                   |
                    
        [   Host  ] | The host signifies the resource location. This can be a hostname or an IP address.                                    |
        
        [   Port  ] | The Port is separated from the Host by a colon (:). If no port is specified,http schemes default to port 80 and https |
                    | default to port 443.                                                                                                  |
                    
        [   Path  ] | This points to the resource being accessed, which can be a file or a folder. If there is no path specified, the       |
                    | server returns the default index (e.g. index.html).                                                                   |
                    
        [ Query String ] | The query string starts with a question mark (?), and consists of a parameter (e.g. login) and a value           |
                         | (e.g. true). Multiple parameters can be separated by an ampersand (&).                                           |
          
        [ Fragment ] | Fragments are processed by the browsers on the client-side to locate sections within the primary resource (e.g. a    |
                     | header or section on the page).                                                                                      |
                     
                     
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) - 
  * We discussed how HTTP requests are sent and processed. However, one of the significant drawbacks of HTTP is that all data is transferred 
    in clear-text. This means that anyone between the source and destination can perform a Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack to view the 
    transferred data.
  * To counter this issue, the HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocol was created, in which all communications are transferred in an encrypted format, 
    so even if a third party does intercept the request, they would not be able to extract the data out of it.
